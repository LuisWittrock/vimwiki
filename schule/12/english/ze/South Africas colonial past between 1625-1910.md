# South Africas colonial Past

## A3
In 1652 the Dutch East India Company came to the Cape of good hope in order to support their fleets which were coming from Europe to Asia.
They met the Indigenous groups of south Africa there which cooperated with them at first but then the Dutch expanded to the east which caused a clash between the two groups 
from 1779-81.
