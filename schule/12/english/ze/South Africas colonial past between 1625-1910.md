# South Africas colonial Past

## A3
In 1652 the Dutch East India Company came to the Cape of good hope in order to support their fleets which were coming from Europe to Asia.
They met the Indigenous groups of south Africa there, which cooperated with them at first, but then the Dutch expanded to the east, which caused a clash between the two groups the First Frontier War which lasted from 1779 to 1781. Then in 1795 the British people occupied the Cape for 8 years before giving control back to the Dutch. But since they had to protect the Cape from the French in the Napoleonic war they retook the Cape. Due to the British people practicing Slavery and introducing English instead of the native language the indigenous people became more resentful of the British. 
1834 many Farmers left the Cape province because the British stopped practicing Slavery but eventually signed treaties with the British in 1854 to establish the Boer Republic.
Though Conflicted arose again because they discovered Diamonds and Gold inside Boers Republic so in order to unite the country the British fought against them again in 1880-1881 and 1899-1902 which are now refered to as the First and Second Anglo-Boer war the second of whose the British won retaking control and making reunification possible.
in 1910 the decision was made, to unite all four British territories and they made a new Constitution which introduced the segregation of race. Basultoland and Swaizland in the south east were still under British control for some time but are now also independent states.
