# Metting the natives of the Cape

Burchells feelings and thoughts on colonialism and the effects it had on the lives of the indigenous population.

Burchell thinks, that the Europeans colonising should be a positive change for a civilization because they bring along with them arts and science. 
Though when he actually gets the chance to talk to the indigenous people he concludes, that the Europeans coming along did not change their 
life in a positive way. The colonisation made a far less happy and a far less peaceful civilization out of them. So even though he thought 
colonialism should be good for the indigenous people, during his research he concluded, that's in fact not the case.
