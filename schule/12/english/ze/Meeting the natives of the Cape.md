# Metting the natives of the Cape

Outline Burchells feelings and thoughts on colonialism and the effects it had on the lives of the indigenous population.

---

"Meeting the natives of the Cape" is a text reporting about Burchells Research of the European colonisation published in 2015.
Burchell thinks, that the Europeans colonising should be a positive change for a civilization, because they bring along with them arts and science. 
Though when he actually gets the chance to talk to the indigenous people he concludes, that the Europeans do not change their 
life in a positive way. The colonisation makes the circumstances of the indigenous population worse than before since they became less peaceful and unhappy. So even though he thought 
colonialism should be good for the indigenous people, during his research he conclude, that's in fact not the case.
